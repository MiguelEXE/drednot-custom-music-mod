# Custom music mod

## Allows drednot.io to play music

How can I do it?

First you need to edit the motd and insert `#SOUND` tag there

The `#SOUND` tag will trigger the mod to play a looping sound.

The syntax of the `#SOUND` tag is: `#SOUND <PLATFORM> <...ID>`

Currently, the mod only supports these platforms:
- Youtube video (YTV)

    Syntax: `#SOUND YTV <YOUTUBE VIDEO ID>`

## Example usage:
`#SOUND YTV 6XKpweg_qwk`
